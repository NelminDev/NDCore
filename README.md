# ‚öôÔ∏è NDCore - Your Minecraft Plugin Foundation

NDCore is a core dependency plugin crafted by nelmin to enhance Minecraft plugin development. It provides essential
utility functions, requiring no configuration, and is designed to improve efficiency and functionality.

## üöÄ Overview

NDCore operates as a lightweight plugin, supporting persistent data management, multilingual localization, player
management, advanced menu handling, and efficient performance. It serves as a foundational library for nelmin's plugin
ecosystem, streamlining player data management and interactions.

The plugin architecture is built around two main classes:

- **NDPlugin**: An abstract base class extending JavaPlugin that provides lifecycle management, enhanced logging, and player data handling capabilities.
- **NDCore**: The concrete implementation that manages persistent player properties, registers event listeners, and performs regular cleanup of offline player data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Plugin Architecture**: Extendable NDPlugin base class with lifecycle management and enhanced logging.
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Scheduled cleanup of offline player data to optimize memory usage.
- **Persistent Data Management**: Robust support for persistent data with type safety and default values.
- **Adventure API Text Handling**: Advanced text formatting using the Adventure API with support for gradients and MiniMessage format.
- **Comprehensive Localization**: Streamlined localization system with support for over 180 languages.
- **Enhanced Player Data**: Basic player data tracking with language preferences.
- **Flexible Menu System**: Simple yet powerful menu system with custom click handlers.
- **Integrated Logging**: Enhanced NDLogger system with INFO, WARN, ERROR, and FATAL levels.
- **Dependency-Only Plugin**: Functions as a core dependency without extra overhead.
- **Zero Configuration**: Ready to use out-of-the-box, no configuration needed.
- **Lightweight & Efficient**: Designed for optimal performance and minimal footprint.
